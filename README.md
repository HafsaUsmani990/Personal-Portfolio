# Personal-Portfolio 💼
This is my personal portfolio website built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
My goal was to create a simple, clean, and visually consistent interface that still reflects my style and personality as a developer.

# Design Approach 🎨
I chose a dark theme with deep maroon and gold tones to give the site a premium, minimal aesthetic.
Background: solid black
Navbar: dark maroon
Text & highlights: light gold for readability and elegance
UI details: soft shadows, smooth hover effects, rounded borders


# Responsiveness 📱
A key focus was making the design fully responsive.
The circular “HU” badge in the navbar has fixed proportions to stay perfectly round on all screen sizes.
Every layout section was styled to display properly across laptops, tablets, and phones.

# Website Sections 🗂️
About Me: A quick introduction to who I am as a developer.
Skills: A grid of skill cards, each with clean icon representation.
Projects: Space to showcase my latest work as I continue building.
Contact Form: A simple but professionally structured form with balanced spacing and accessible inputs.

# What I Learned 📘

Writing cleaner, more organized HTML
